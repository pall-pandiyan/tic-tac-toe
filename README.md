# tic-tac-toe
Creating a simple tic tac toe game (terminal based). Currently the computer's move is totally random, in future we need to improve it.

## ttt.py

In 'ttt.py' I simply implement a 3x3 tic tac toe game. But i feel this one is not scalable to a bigger board for bigger challange. The condition for checking if a player or computer won is seems very hard coded and not at all flexible.

## ttt-2.py

I started the 'ttt-2.py' with sole intention of creating something more stable and flexible. In the end I am somewhat satisfied with this result i got. Now i can change the board size (both row and colume number should be a same number for obvious reasons).


## Future aspects of improvements

Now if the set the board size to 3x3, the game is somewhat playable. The reason for this is for every computer's turn i randomly picking a empty cell and mark it.

In future i want to choose the best position to win the player.
